# SafeHaven
SafeHaven is a personalized, risk‑adjusted housing desirability tool that helps people find where to live based on their tolerance for different natural disasters.

## Overview
Our goal is to build a risk‑adjusted housing desirability index using weather and disaster datasets along with current housing “hotness” data to generate a desirability score by city/metropolitan area. Users can specify how averse they are to different natural disasters (for example: coastal flooding, hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, drought, heat waves), and SafeHaven will surface locations that best match their preferences through an interactive map.
